Got it. Here’s the same README in very plain and simple English:

---

# Academic Portal

## About

This is a student dashboard made with React.
It has a top navbar, a sidebar on the left, and a main content area.
Right now it shows pages like Personal Info, Courses, Assignments, and CGPA.

## What is done till now

* Navbar with logo, breadcrumb, and profile button
* Sidebar with links to pages
* Content area that shows the page when you click a link
* By default, Personal Info page is shown
* Dark theme added

## What I still need to do

* Make sidebar work better on small screens (slide in and out)
* Improve design of the content area
* Add real form inputs and save data
* Connect to backend or API for real student details
* Add login and roles (student, admin)
* Write tests and clean the code

Do you also want me to make this README short enough for a **GitHub project front page** (just 6–7 lines max), or keep it slightly detailed like this?
